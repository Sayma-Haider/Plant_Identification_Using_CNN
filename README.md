# Plant_Identification_Using_CNN
In this experiment CNN-based sequential model (from scratch) was built, also pre-trained models like VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, Xception was used. 
And hybrid models comprising CNN and LSTM was also built for comparative analysis.
This experiment was done on three private datasets comprising of images of flowers, fruits, and leaves from local Bangladeshi plants. These images were taken using phone camera and
also was collected from Google images. The flower dataset contains three classes, fruit dataset contains two classes, and leaves dataset contains five classes of plants.
The pretrained models and the CNN models outperformed the CNN-LSTM models with higher, accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score.
